Nothing fancy.</p><p>But in 2021, I pushed a big change to this website’s repository. I moved from that super simple single HTML and CSS file setup to a <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish-powered site</a>. Publish, for those not in the know (most people), is a Swift-backed static site generator.</p><p>I made the switch to Publish for a few reasons:</p><p>•	I like Swift, and Publish’s SwiftUI-inspired syntax for building a site just works for my brain.	•	I wanted a place to blog.	•	I wanted a place to post my astrophotography photos.</p><p>Maybe my goopy-goblin-gamer brain kicked in, but I wasn’t really happy with what I built. I didn’t like the layouts, the colors, or the styling... I could go on. So, I ended up just removing everything that wasn’t the “About” page, and I left it like that for three years.</p><p>But that changes today.</p><p>Is my CSS exactly how I want it?</p><p>No.</p><p>Do I have a fancy publishing workflow that will automatically publish when I merge to main?</p><p>No.</p><p>Is this the first big blog post where I described writing this site in Publish in detail?</p><p>No, I deleted that.</p><p>It’s a new beginning. I’m going to try to publish here at least once a month.</p><p>What’s going to end up here?</p><p><strong>No clue.</strong></p><p>But hey, I think I got the RSS feed working, so if you want to follow along, there’s that.</p><p>🙂</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
