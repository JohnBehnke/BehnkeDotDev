Why so simple? While I can do front-end development, I wouldn’t call myself a front-end developer. I’ve always gravitated towards dealing with data in the backend over flexing boxes and slinging divs. So when it came time to build out a personal portfolio/resume site, I grabbed some of the css from the wonderful <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>, tweaked it a bit, slapped by face on it, got roasted by buddy for using body tags like divs, and called it a day. From 2016 until about the middle of last year, thats how it stayed, save for I think two redesigns and some content upates.<br><br> <img src="/images/posts/2023/03/12/old_site_1.jpg"/> <em> The oldest version the site, complete with mid 2010's "card" styling </em><br> <img src="/images/posts/2023/03/12/old_site_2.jpg"/> <em> In 2017, I added particles.js along with a border to the profile picture that would randomly select from some colors </em><br> <img src="/images/posts/2023/03/12/old_site_3.jpg"/> <em> In April of 2020, a month into COVID-19 lockdowns, I ripped out most of the site and made it a lot simpler. </em><br><br>While I don't like doing front-end work <em>on the web</em>, I actually don't mind doing it for Apple's platforms, especically since SwiftUI came out in 2019. I don't know <em>why</em> exactly, but at least part of the issue is that I don't like HTML+CSS. Ideally, I'd be able to write my personal site in some Swift-related stack. For a little bit I toyed around with the idea creating my own static site generator.</p><p>Thankfully I didn’t have to.</p><p>Around the end of December in 2019, John Sundell, a prolific Swift developer/guru and podcaster released his open source static site generator written in Swift, called <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>. Having heard him talk about creating Publish on the podcasts he hosts, I was extremely interested in giving it a shot. In May of 2020, a few months into the crazy world of COVID-19, I decided to dive in.</p><p>It's 2023 now... roughly three years later. What gives? Well a couple of things actually.</p><p>Publish was still relativly new at the time and the documentation around it wasn't particulary the comprehensive, escpecically compared to other static site generators</p><ul><li>My initial</li></ul><p>-May 2020, I started the redesign in Publish<br><br>- Talk about the difficulty of using a new framework with having to design the site at the same time - Talk about the awkwardness of the initial API - Talk about after SwiftUI came out, John Sundell released a newer API and that made building the components easier - Give an overall impression of Publish (mention that I may go deeper into this in another post) - Talk about why starting to “blog” (good practice for writing, maybe I’ll write about something someone finds useful, etc) - Talk about future plans for the site (at least 12 posts a year, have links to side projects, astrobehnke.space)</p></div></div></div><footer><div class="socials"><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@johnbehnke" target="_blank"><img src="/images/mastodon.svg"/></a><a href="https://github.com/JohnBehnke" target="_blank"><img src="/images/github.svg"/></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-behnke-38b8b419b" target="_blank"><img src="/images/linkedin.svg"/></a></div><p>Written in 100% Swift</p><p>Generated Using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>Copyright © 2023 John Behnke</p><p><a href="/post.rss">RSS Feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
