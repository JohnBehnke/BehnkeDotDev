Why so simple? While I can do front-end development, I wouldn't call myself a front-end developer. I've always gravitated towards dealing with data in the back-end over flexing boxes and slinging divs. So when it came time to build out a personal portfolio/resume site, I grabbed some of the css from the wonderful <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>, tweaked it a bit, slapped by face on it, got roasted by buddy for using body tags like divs, and called it a day. From 2016 until about the middle of last year, that's how it stayed, save for I think two redesigns and some content updates.<br><br> <img src="/images/posts/2023/03/12/old_site_1.jpg"/> <em> The oldest version the site, complete with mid 2010's "card" styling </em><br> <img src="/images/posts/2023/03/12/old_site_2.jpg"/> <em> In 2017, I added particles.js along with a border to the profile picture that would randomly select from some colors </em><br> <img src="/images/posts/2023/03/12/old_site_3.jpg"/> <em> In April of 2020, a month into COVID-19 lock downs, I ripped out most of the site and made it a lot simpler. </em><br><br>While I don't like doing front-end work <em>on the web</em>, I actually don't mind doing it for Apple's platforms, especically since SwiftUI came out in 2019. I don't know <em>why</em> exactly, but at least part of the issue is that I don't like HTML+CSS. Ideally, I'd be able to write my personal site in some Swift-related stack. For a little bit I toyed around with the idea creating my own static site generator.</p><p>Thankfully I didn't have to.</p><p>Around the end of December in 2019, John Sundell, a prolific Swift developer and podcaster released his open source static site generator written in Swift, called <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish" target="_blank">Publish</a>. Having heard him talk about creating Publish on the podcasts he hosts, I was extremely interested in giving it a shot. In May of 2020, a few months into the crazy world of COVID-19, I decided to dive in.</p><p>My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOPIobI_0B8" target="_blank">main goal</a> was to move the site from a single page "billboard" of a site into something larger, with an area for me to blog, an area to show off stuff I've been working on, and a gallary of my growing collection of astrophotography images. This isn't anything ground breaking, so I was hoping it would take a few weekends to knock out. Obviously this didn't work out, given its 2023 and I'm only now just publishing this new version. What gives?</p><p>It turns out, trying to redesign your site without any kind of mock-up or idea of what I wanted it to look like was a bad decision. Couple this with my general disinterest in front-end <em>AND</em> the lack of resources around the initial version of Publish, <a href="https://youtu.be/Qp1oN23xotM?t=5" target="blank">I was straight up not having a good time</a>. Starting to feel burnt out on it, I shelved the redesign for about a year.</p><p>In May of 2021, <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/introducing-plot-components/" target="_blank"> John Sundell released a new version of Plot</a> (the library Publish uses for converting Swift to HTML) that totally reinvigorated my drive for this redesign. Working with it's new component-based API felt way more natural to me, having been toying around with SwiftUI the past year. Instead of fighting both the tooling and the design, I was now only fighting the design. So for the next two-ish years, I slowly picked away at the resign. I settled on the current layout pretty quickly, so my effort mostly went into getting bare bones implementation to look good.</p><p>And well, here I am now. Its <em>mostly</em> where I want it to be (I think). So what am I going to do here? I think I want to aim for a blog post a month. What about exactly? I don't really know. Maybe it'll be some long stream of conscience about the rumored upcoming Apple XR headset, or a rant about some small bug in some tool I'm working with driving me crazy. Maybe I'll write about a solution I found to some obscure problem in the hopes my dinky little blog can help someone else out. Who knows.</p><p>Anyways, thanks for reading.
