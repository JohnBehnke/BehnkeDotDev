I'm a software developer out of Connecticut. Currently, I'm working at IBM doing primarily back-end development with some front-end work sprinkled in. I'm into back-end development, mobile development, devops work flows, UI/UX design, and a whole bunch more.

Feel free to reach out to me. My résumé and Github accounts are linked here along with a quick link for email.
