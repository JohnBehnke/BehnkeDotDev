I'm a software developer out of Connecticut.  I'm into back-end development, mobile development, devops work flows, UI/UX design, and a whole bunch more.

Currently, I'm a software developer at IBM in the Digital Workplace Engineering group. I primarily focus on backend development, but I do frontend work occasionally.  

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu) in 2017.

Feel free to reach out to me.
