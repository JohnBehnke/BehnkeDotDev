description: Creating a website in Swift via Publish.
---

Ever since I built this website back in November 2016, it has been a single HTML page with inline CSS. Why so simple? While I can do front-end development, I wouldn’t call myself a front-end developer. I’ve always gravitated towards dealing with data in the backend over flexing boxes and slinging divs. So when it came time to build out a personal portfolio/resume site, I grabbed some of the css from the wonderful [bettermotherfuckingwebsite](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com), tweaked it a bit, slapped by face on it, got roasted by buddy for using body tags like divs, and called it a day. From 2016 until about the middle of last year, thats how it stayed, save for I think two redesigns and some content upates.

    * In 2017, I added particles.js along with a border to the profile picture that would randomly select from some colors *

    * In April of 2020, a month into COVID-19 lockdowns, I ripped out most of the site and made it a lot simpler. *
    

While I don't like doing front-end work *on the web*, I actually don't mind doing it for Apple's platforms, especically since SwiftUI came out in 2019. I don't know *why* exactly, but at least part of the issue is that I don't like HTML+CSS. Ideally, I'd be able to write my personal site in some Swift-related stack. For a little bit I toyed around with the idea creating my own static site generator. 

Thankfully I didn’t have to.

Around the end of December in 2019, John Sundell, a prolific Swift developer/guru and podcaster released his open source static site generator written in Swift, called [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish). Having heard him talk about creating Publish on the podcasts he hosts, I was extremely interested in giving it a shot. In May of 2020, a few months into the crazy world of COVID-19, I decided to dive in.

It's 2023 now... roughly three years later. What gives? Well a couple of things actually. 

Publish was still relativly new at the time and the documentation around it wasn't particulary the comprehensive, escpecically compared to other static site generators. 

- My initial 

-May 2020, I started the redesign in Publish  

- Talk about the difficulty of using a new framework with having to design the site at the same time
- Talk about the awkwardness of the initial API
- Talk about after SwiftUI came out, John Sundell released a newer API and that made building the components easier
- Give an overall impression of Publish (mention that I may go deeper into this in another post)
- Talk about why starting to “blog” (good practice for writing, maybe I’ll write about something someone finds useful, etc)
- Talk about future plans for the site (at least 12 posts a year, have links to side projects, astrobehnke.space)
